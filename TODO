+ Retarget what I'm trying to do, no SQL, just use basic files and directories
(at least to begin with). Actions would be cool, though.

List of requirements for MVP:

+ Attach some kind of database to show available projects on index page
+ Add project search
+ Add profile view
+ Project management, creation/deletion
  + Cookies

Possible extensions in the future:

+ In-project search
+ Issues
+ Pull requests
+ Git blame
+ User configurable CSS
